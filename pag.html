        <h1>My internship as a software engineer at CSUC</h1>
	<p>One can think that an internship can be useless or only something for the CV, but here I'll explain what I did so you take that idea out of your mind.</p>
	<p>First of all let me present the company where I did my internship for 6 months, it's called CSUC and the logo looks like this:</p>

	<p> Nice, isn't it? Well it's nice actually, it's a company that works mainly for the Catalan Government (Generalitat de Catalunya), and therefore, they maintain do
	   all type of IT work that you can imagine for them.</p>
