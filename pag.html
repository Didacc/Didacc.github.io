        <h1>My internship as a software engineer at CSUC</h1>
	<p>One can think that an internship can be useless or only something for the CV, but here I'll explain what I did so you take that idea out of your mind.</p>
	<p>First of all let me present the company where I did my internship for 6 months, it's called CSUC and the logo looks like this:</p>
	<a href="https://www.csuc.cat/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
		<img src="csuc_logo.png" alt="csuc_logo" style="width:50%; margin:3%;">
	</a>
	<p> Nice, isn't it? Well it's nice actually, it's a company that works mainly for the Catalan Government (Generalitat de Catalunya), and therefore, they maintain and do
	   all type of IT work that you can imagine.</p>
	<br>
	<p>Time to explain what I did there, not big projects as you can imagine but still some interesting stuff:</p>
	<ul>
