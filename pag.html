            <article class="content">
                <p>One can think that an internship can be useless or only something for the CV, but here I'll explain what I did so you take that idea out of your mind.</p>
                <p>First of all let me present the company where I did my internship for 6 months, it's called CSUC and the logo looks like this:</p>

                <a class="logo-link" href="https://www.csuc.cat/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
                    <img src="csuc_logo.png" alt="CSUC logo">
                </a>

                <p>Nice, isn't it? Well it's nice actually, it's a company that works mainly for the Catalan Government (Generalitat de Catalunya), and therefore, they maintain and do all type of IT work that you can imagine.</p>
                <p>Time to explain what I did there, not big projects as you can imagine but still some interesting stuff:</p>
