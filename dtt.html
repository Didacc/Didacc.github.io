                <p>Cybersecurity has always been one of my favourite fields. Already during the career, we used to do one subject called Computer Security where we saw the basics of Cybersecurity.</p>
                <p>A nice teacher joined with a personal motivation made Cybersecurity my preference when trying to find a job. That's why, after I finished my internship, I applied for some Cybersecurity related job offers. Spoiler done in the title, I ended up in Deloitte Spain, working as a Cybersecurity Consultant.</p>
